Asymmetric/Symmetric Encryption Method (slower method)

Assumptions: 
User has been authenticated if they have access to main menu (this should be considered as a secure session with all communications being secure until timeout)
User has been provided with the public key from the client

Storing a new password:
1] GUI: User enters new password 
Encryption happens with public key (client)
2] GUI: Relay password information to the server
3] Server: send write request to the client 
4] Server: sends password information to the client
5] Client: receives password from server
6] Client: writes password to database

Accessing a stored password:
1] GUI: User requests to view stored password
2] GUI: relays password ID to server
3] Server: sends read request to client
4] Server: sends password ID to client
5] Client: looks up password with ID
Decryption happens with private key (client)
Encryption happens with public key (server)
6] Client: sends data to server
7] Server: sends encrypted password to GUI
Decryption happens with private key (server)
8] GUI: Displays password in plain text
