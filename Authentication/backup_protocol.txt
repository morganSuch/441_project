1] Failed Biometric Authentication

- GUI prompted backup login sequence for password and security question
    - Complexity standard for this (8 chars, 1 upper, 1 lower, 1 special)
    - Security question/image/something else will be something they pick from a list and is either linked to the password or has its own customizable field
        - Ex. answer to security question is customizable, image is not
    - This will be the fail safe for all backup authentication methods even if the user decides to configure something else as a primary option
- User can configure their primary backup method in user settings to attempt to login that way first, however if that method fails then they must use fail safe method


2] Device unreachable

- This will be a case in which the device stops working completely or the device is lost/damaged. 
- Full Data Backup
    - We could offer this for user convenience if they user wants to extract the data but at this point the security of the data is out of our hands
    - If at any point they want to take data off of the device thatâ€™s not in our domain
Options for this:
- Extract to cloud backup
- Extract to USB
- Extract to local file
